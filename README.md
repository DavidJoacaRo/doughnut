# Welcome to NolanBot!
## It's a bot I made as a meme.

To run the bot, you need to have node.js installed first. If you haven't installed it yet, download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Also you need a bot token. If you haven't created one yet, go to https://discord.com/developers/applications/ and create a new application. Then, go to the "Bot" tab, click on "Add Bot" and copy the token. **KEEP THIS TOKEN PRIVATE!**

# How to install
1) Open command prompt in the bot's directory and type: `npm install`
2) Modify the token.js file and change it to your own token

# Run the bot
## Windows
Simply open the `NolanBot.bat` file.

## Linux
If you're on Linux open the `NolanBot.sh` file to start the bot or type `node .` into the console.
